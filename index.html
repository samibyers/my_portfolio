        <article>
            <p>I grew up in Olympia, Washington and lived there my whole life until I was 16 years old. At 16, I had the opportunity to travel abroad with a student exchange program and I took it. I lived in Switzerland for a year and I got to travel all around Europe and meet other young people from all around the world. It was such an amazing opportunity and I'm still so grateful I was able to immerse myslef completely in another culture at such a young age. Later, I went to Univeristy of Washington and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. My intention was to go to PA school with my degree and work in healthcare with patients. I have worked different jobs in healthcare since college and I recently realized I don't have a passion for patient care and I don't want to pursue PA school or any other role in healthcare. I enjoy working at a computer and I have really enjoyed learning how to code so far! I am ready for the challenges ahead and very excited for a new career! </p>

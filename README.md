My_Portfolio

I created a webpage from scratch that includes an html document, a reset css file, and a linked css stylesheet. This webpage is a portfolio including some information about me and contact information that I will be able to link future work to. There are a few elements on the page that don't change with the screen size adjustments perfectly, but hopefully I will be able to come back and rework these in the future.
